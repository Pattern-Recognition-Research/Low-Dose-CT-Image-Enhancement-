Low-Dose CT Image Enhancement Using Deep Learning

The application of ionizing radiation for diagnostic imaging is common around the globe. However, the process of imaging, itself, remains to be a relatively hazardous operation. Therefore, it is preferable to use as low a dose of ionizing radiation as possible, particularly in computed tomography (CT) imaging systems, where multiple x-ray operations are performed for the reconstruction of slices of body tissues. A popular method for radiation dose reduction in CT imaging is known as the quarter-dose technique, which reduces the x-ray dose but can cause a loss of image sharpness. Since CT image reconstruction from directional x-rays is a nonlinear process, it is analytically difficult to correct the effect of dose reduction on image quality. Recent and popular deep-learning approaches provide an intriguing possibility of image enhancement for low-dose artifacts. Some recent works propose combinations of multiple deep-learning and classical methods for this purpose, which over-complicate the process. However, it is observed here that the straight utilization of the well-known U-NET provides very successful results for the correction of low-dose artifacts. Blind tests with actual radiologists reveal that the U-NET enhanced quarter-dose CT images not only provide an immense visual improvement over the low-dose versions, but also become diagnostically preferable images, even when compared to their full-dose CT versions.
